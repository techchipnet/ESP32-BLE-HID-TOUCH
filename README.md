This project transforms an ESP32 and a touchscreen display into a powerful, bluetooth rubber ducky. It connects to your device like pc,laptop or smartphone via Bluetooth LE and acts as a bluetooth keyboard, allowing you to execute complex keystrokes, payloads, macros, and scripts with a single touch.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Touch-based Interface:** Three fully customizable on-screen buttons.
* **Bluetooth LE Connectivity:** No wires needed; connect directly to your Windows, macOS, Linux computers or Android, iOS Smart phone.
* **Powerful Scripting Engine:** Create complex payloads and scripts via the `payload.txt` file. Supports key combinations, text typing, and delays.
* **External Configuration:** No need to recompile the code to change keystrokes. Simply edit and upload a text file.
* **On-screen Status:** Displays Bluetooth connection status and other information on the screen.
* **Pre-compiled Binary:** No need to compile the sketch. Pre-compiled binary is available in the release page.
* **Ducky Script Compatible:** Easily change & write payloads in Ducky Script style with all keys mapped as in Ducky Script.
* **Web Flasher Support:** Flash your ESP32 directly from your browser using the web flasher at [esptool.spacehuhn.com](http://esptool.spacehuhn.com).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation

### Pre-compiled Binary (No Arduino IDE needed)

1. Download the pre-compiled binary from the [Releases](https://github.com/techchipnet/ESP32-BLE-HID-GUI/releases) page.
2. Use one of the following methods to flash the binary:

   #### Web Flasher (Easiest Method)
   1. First install USB to UART Bridge VCP Driver. you can download this driver from here [Driver](https://www.silabs.com/software-and-tools/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers?tab=downloads)
   2. Visit [esptool.spacehuhn.com](http://esptool.spacehuhn.com)
   3. Plug in your ESP32 & select the port
   4. Click on "Connect"
   5. Add the downloaded .bin file & set the address
   6. Click "Program" to flash it

   #### Command Line Example
   ```bash
   esptool.py --chip esp32 --port [PORT] --baud 921600 write_flash 0x0 firmware.bin
   ```

### Upload the Payload File (`payload.bin`)

1.  Frist prepare the payload.txt file with your payload, Open termial run the following command to create the `payload.bin` image:
    ```bash
    mkspiffs -c data -b 4096 -p 256 -s 0x160000 payload.bin
    ```
2.  Put the ESP32 into upload mode again.
3.  Now, upload this image to the correct address:
    ```bash
    esptool --chip esp32 --port /dev/cu.usbserial-0001 --baud 921600 write_flash 0x290000 payload.bin
    ```
4.  Restart the ESP32. Your device is now ready!

## üöÄ Payload Configuration (Ducky Script Syntax)

You can write your payload in the `payload.txt` file using a simple scripting language.

* **Commands:** `PRESS`, `TYPE`, `DELAY`, `ENTER`
* **Separator:** Separate each command with a semicolon (`;`).

| Command | Example           | Description                                    |
| :------ | :---------------- | :--------------------------------------------- |
| `PRESS` | `PRESS GUI,r`     | Presses one or more keys simultaneously.       |
| `TYPE`  | `TYPE Hello World`| Types the given text.                          |
| `DELAY` | `DELAY 1000`      | Pauses for the given number of milliseconds (1000ms = 1s). |
| `ENTER` | `ENTER`           | Presses the Enter key.                         |

**Supported Keywords:** `GUI` (or `WINDOWS`), `CTRL`, `ALT`, `SHIFT`, `ENTER`, `ESC`, `BACKSPACE`, `TAB`, `CAPS_LOCK`, `DELETE`, `INSERT`, `HOME`, `END`, `PAGE_UP`, `PAGE_DOWN`, `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, `SPACE`, and `F1` through `F12`.
